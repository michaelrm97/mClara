# Clara Mini

## Background

The other Project C.L.A.R.A (Christmas Light Array Running on Azure) was conceived in 2020 as an LED Christmas light display controllable from the web. See [https://github.com/michaelrm97/clara](https://github.com/michaelrm97/clara) for information about the previous project.

## Components

There are three components of this:

- PCB with an LED light array in the shape of a Christmas card
- Laser cut plywood covers glued to the back and front of the PCB. The front contains a Christmas tree graphic and the back contains a festive greeting with a QR code linking to a personal message
- Web app hosting the card message. See [README](./software/README.md)
